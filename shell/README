SHELL
------------------------------------------------------------
Contains useful shell scripts for running index calculations 
from the command line.

Paths to certain functions will have to be modified for these 
to work when downloaded to new file system. See the comments 
inside the scripts for details.

run_* - these functions run the relevant indices. They can 
        run from a list of command line arguments or by
        prompting the user for input. To run interactively 
        type "run_* help"

tinfo - will display header info for a datafile output by
        one of the index functions, or information about 
        a raw VPSC file.

textr - can extract strain steps from a VPSC file, skipping 
        a user defined number. This is useful when the VPSC
        files have many steps but only a few are needed.
