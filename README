SOURCE CODE: TextureStrength toolbox
-------------------------------------------------
Lewis Bailey
April 2016

This Matlab toolbox was created as part of a final year
undergraduate project in accordance with the requirements 
of BSc Geophysical Sciences (Industrial).

-------------- TEXTURE STRENGTH TOOLBOX ----------------

This set of Matlab functions allows simple calculation of a
number of measures of texture strength, as well as additional,
related functionality. These measures can be calculated from 
VPSC or EBSD (*.ctf) format. 

Extensive documentation is included within the functions, 
which can be accessed using help [ function ] within Matlab.

General structure:

READFILES - functions to read in/sample data
J_INDEX   - function to calculate the J-index
M_INDEX	  - functions to calculate discrete and continuous M-index
ANALYSIS  - functions to allow further analysis and additional functionality
SHELL     - some useful shell scripts to use with the toolbox (e.g. run from command line

-----------------------------------------------------

TO SETUP:

1) Install the MTEX and MSAT packages:

  MTEX: http://mtex-toolbox.github.io/
  MSAT: http://github.com/andreww/MSAT 

and place them in the same directory.

2) Download this toolbox, unzip and place the directory in the same
location as the MTEX and MSAT directories e.g:

~ $ ls
   mtex-4.3.1   msat-1.1.1   TextureStrength
~ $ _

3) Open Matlab and add the TextureStrength directory to the path

4) Run the script setup_env

(If issues are encountered, or a different directory structure is 
required, then edit setup_env so that the paths added are absolute
as opposed to relative)
